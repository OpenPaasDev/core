# OpenPaas Core
Ties together Terraform, Ansible and Runtime execution of commands (local) to create a generic base for automation with these tools.

A generalisation of the original OpenPaas code, to be incorporated there later.


## TODO
- [ ] Fix Volumes and volume attachment in Terraform
- [ ] Correctly parse new format of Terraform outputs
