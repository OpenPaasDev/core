# OpenPaas Core
Ties together Terraform, Ansible and Runtime execution of commands (local) to create a generic base for automation with these tools.

A generalisation of the original OpenPaas code, to be incorporated there later.


## TODO
- [ ] Correctly parse new format of Terraform outputs
- [ ] Support server group aliases (use: can support multiple Ansible targets, in case servers are shared, for instance, running multiple services, such as Consul and Nomad on the same server group)
